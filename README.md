Why Buzz-Kill

Every restaurant, bar and club owner wants to provide a safe and enjoyable guest experience.  Buzz-Kill is an easy-to-use tool that helps managers and their staff monitor patrons' alcohol consumption and spot potential problems early.  It requires minimal additional effort by servers and presents information in a format that is easy for busy managers to process in a quick glance.
